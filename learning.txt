I created this repository to learn and practice Git, a powerful version control system.
 It’s my personal sandbox to experiment with Git commands, understand workflows, and get comfortable with version control.
  The repo contains introduction.txt, a text file with a brief introduction about myself, which I use to practice Git operations like committing, branching, and pushing. I can clone this repo to my local machine, modify introduction.txt, and practice commands like git add, git commit, git push, and git branch. My goals are to master basic Git commands (init, commit, push, pull, branch, merge), understand branching and merging, and experiment with collaboration features like pull requests and resolving merge conflicts. I’m excited to use this repo to improve my Git skills by adding new files or tweaking existing ones!
